<p>Lindsay was not due until March 20th, but baby boy #2 decided to come a little early. Around 8:30 AM on March 15th, Lindsay started having contractions. G was called to come stay with Joe, and by 1:00 PM we were at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. Lindsay was certainly glad to be having the baby a few days early, especially since Joe was so late.  It turned out to be a good thing that the baby came a little early because the COVID-19 pandemic made things a little interesting at the hospital.</p>
<p>The hospital was taking extra precautions to make sure that no one with any COVID-19 symptoms or risk factors was entering the hospital. Everyone was screened on the way in, and all visitors had to be given a visitor&rsquo;s pass. Only one visitor at a time was allowed, and that person could not rotate.  Meaning, you got to pick one person and that was it.  This wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal for us except for one thing &ndash; that meant Joe could not come to the hospital to meet his new baby brother. He would have to wait until we got home to meet him.</p>
<p>By around 7:00 PM Lindsay was officially admitted and was moved to a labor &amp; delivery room (a nice one according to Svetlana, the nurse.)  Things moved along, and Lindsay and I walked the floor of the L &amp; D wing back and forth over and over.  Just before midnight was when the show really started. We had pretty much settled on a name but hadn&rsquo;t committed to it 100%. Once he was here though, we both agreed to go with our original choice. At 12:31 AM on Monday, March 16, 2020, John &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Philip O&rsquo;Sullivan was born! Lindsay was a <strong>BEAST</strong>.  No epidural, and once things really got going, baby boy was out in a snap!</p>

<p>We were back in the post natal recovery room by ~3:00 AM and were thankful that Newton-Wellesley still has a nursery so we could get some rest.  While we were there, things in the world kept getting weirder. More an more cases of COVID-19 were being diagnosed, governments started putting more restrictions in place, and the economy and stock market kept spiralling further downward. Even after just receiving the gift of a new baby, it was hard to not focus on the news. The hospital started to enact stricter policies as well. For instance, only staff were allowed in the kitchenette, so we had to call for the nurse for something as mundane as a water refill. Thankfully, the L &amp; D department is located at the West entrance to the hospital and the ED is located at the East entrance.  So, anyone showing up to the hospital with possible COVID symptoms would not be crossing paths with new or expectant moms (and dads!)</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, the West entrance was now being closed at 6:00 PM. I ordered take out from Uber Eats and my poor Uber Eats driver ended up at the East entrance and not the West.  I stepped outside to try and find them and promptly got locked out!  I had to jog to the East entrance where the ED is to pick up my food and get back in the building.  As I was running up the hill to the ED entrance I thought to myself, &ldquo;You better slow down or people are going to freak out when they see someone running up to the entrance to the ED.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the day on Monday, March 16, we talked with the pediatrician and nurse and agreed that we would like to get out of the hospital and back home ASAP.  Since we were second time parents, and Jack was healthy, the staff felt comfortable sending us home at 36 hours rather than the normal 48.  So, on Tuesday morning we started getting ready to leave.  Just after noon, all the necessary checks and paperwork had been finished and we were ready to go home!</p>

<p>We arrived home to find Joe eagerly waiting for us and wearing his new big brother shirt.  We had talked with him about getting a new brother, and he knew we had left to go to the hospital so Mommy could deliver the baby, but we wouldn&rsquo;t know for sure how he would react until he same the baby with his own eyes.  At first he was a bit indifferent and didn&rsquo;t want to hold Jack.  He kinda gave him a &ldquo;&lsquo;sup baby&rdquo; and that was it.  After a while though, he asked to hold him and it&rsquo;s been &ldquo;my baby&rdquo; ever since!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like we had a lot of plans right after having a new baby, but once we got home a shelter-in-place order was strongly urged (not mandated), people were still being told so socially distance themselves, and all non-essential business were ordered to close in addition to the schools and daycares that were already closed.  So, were getting used to being a family of four during the Great Quarantine of 2020!  There are some long days and long nights, but were counting our blessings and thankful for what he have.</p>
